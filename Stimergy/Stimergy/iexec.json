    "Stimergy redefines the data center as a distributed collection of computing units interconnected by optical networks. Each unit, denominated a “digital furnace”, integrates several high performance servers as its heat source. Stimergy's data furnaces are deployed within the secured technical rooms of buildings, where they deliver their heat to hot water distribution pipes, making it possible to cover from 30 to 60% of the hot water energy needs of a residential building.",
